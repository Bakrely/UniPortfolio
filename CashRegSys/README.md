Task definition

Your company is developing a modern cash register system to bill commissions in European supermarkets as well as smaller local food product markets. The company analyzed the state of the art techniques, consulted prospective large customers (operators of supermarket chains) intensively, carried out surveys with typical customers of food markets and conducted a weak point analysis in the currently deployed systems. Therefore, the company’s marketing division set the Design Input Requirements (DIRs) mentioned below. The company management formed a project team (Core Team) and instructed it to develop a market-ready cash register system within one year. The project leader R&D Software is the responsible core team member for software development. The development team is staffed by up to 7 software developers including yourself. 
Prior to releasing any further development funds, the company management instructed you to create a system prototype and derive an efficient software architecture within an integrated concept and feasibility phase. 
According to the company’s software and system development guidelines, the following deliverables must be generated and reviewed before releasing AFD and entering development phase: 
	1.	Completed or corrected DIRs, in case you detect significant gaps or inconsistencies in the DIR document.  
	2.	Verification method per DIR, which allows you to prove, that the final (software) product meets the requirement.  
	3.	Documented Context Model  
	4.	Documented Use Case Model  
	5.	Documented Activity Model  
	6.	Documented Entity Model, especially including attribute types and range of values as well as methods’ signatures.  
	7.	Documented State Diagrams of the entities, as necessary.  
	8.	Sound concept of the software architecture.  
According to the development guidelines, the deliverables of the development phase are: 
9. Detailed software specifications, as far as necessary 10. C++ source code 11. Module tests (conducted by developer) 12. System integration test(s)
